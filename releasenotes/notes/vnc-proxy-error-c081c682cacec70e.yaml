    In the Xena release, TLS for VNC is enabled by default, for existing
    deployments this will prevent console access to existing virtual machines,
    as this configuration change does not apply to existing virtual machines.
    Virtual machines created after the configuration change are not affected.

    The virtual machines will run correctly, but your are not able to access
    them via the console. There are three possible solutions to enable console
    access for existing virtual machines; disable TLS for VNC, restart the
    virtual machine or live migrate the virtual machine.

    TLS for VNC can be disabled by setting ``nova_qemu_vnc_tls`` variable to
    ``0`` in the ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`` file.
