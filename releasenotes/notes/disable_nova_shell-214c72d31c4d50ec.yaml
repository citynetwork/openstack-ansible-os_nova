    From now on ``nova_system_shell`` depends on the value of
    nova_libvirtd_listen_tls by default. When libvirt listens on tls we
    assume that tunnelled migration is not used, so nova user does not
    need shell access and it will be disabled. When nova_libvirtd_listen_tls
    is disabled, ``nova_system_shell`` will be set to /bin/bash
